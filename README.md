THEOS Tweaks edt my kieran minec youtube / twitter
============

Tweaks that don't merit their own repositories.

StatusVol
---

A competitor to StatusHUD. StatusVol was released as a beta before StatusHUD launched for iOS7. Since then, it's been somewhat maintained to provide the general functionality behind StatusHUD as a free and open-source alternative. By merely manipulating HUDViews, StatusHUD maintains compatibility with the majority of volume HUD tweaks and the stability of stock iOS HUDViews.

Bolt
---

A simple battery bolt tweak, first to hit for iOS7.
